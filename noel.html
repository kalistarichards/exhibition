		<h2>Project 1 Overview:</h2><p style="font-size: 23px">For Humanities 10, after interviewing our family member or community member for World History, we were told to make a layered subject portrait of the person we interviewed. We used Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit) to create the 2 images down below. For my subject's portrait, I used 25 photos that he had brought up during the interview. For my self-portrait, I used 25 photos that I thought best represented my top three character strengths, love, gratitude, and social intelligence.</p>

		<h3>Essay:</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 23px">My essay explains, develops, and circles around a big idea. My big idea was about Philippines still being a place with thankful people even though it's a third world country. My essay weaves in, seamlessy, the voices of others. These voices could include quotes from reading, sources on the internet, song lyrics, overheard conversations, or family sayings to push against, agree with, or flesh out our thinking. How I came up with the idea of writing an essay about the Philippines is because of my father. He had talked about it in our interview for World History, which was conducting research on the personal history of a family member.</p>
