		<h2>Project 1 Overview:</h2><p style="font-size: 23px">For Humanities 10, after interviewing our family member or community member for World History, we were told to make a layered subject portrait of the person we interviewed. We used Adobe Photoshop CS6 (64 Bit) to create the 2 images down below. For my subject's portrait, I used 25 photos that he had brought up during the interview. For my self-portrait, I used 25 photos that I thought best represented my top three character strengths, love, gratitude, and social intelligence.</p>

		<h3>Essay:</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 23px">My essay explains, develops, and circles around a big idea. My big idea was about Philippines still being a place with thankful people even though it's a third world country. My essay weaves in, seamlessy, the voices of others. These voices could include quotes from reading, sources on the internet, song lyrics, overheard conversations, or family sayings to push against, agree with, or flesh out our thinking. How I came up with the idea of writing an essay about the Philippines is because of my father. He had talked about it in our interview for World History, which was conducting research on the personal history of a family member.</p>

		<h2>Project 2 Overview:</h2>For our 2nd project in Humanities 10, we were told to make a poem for the topics Child Labor and Social Media. In our poems, we incorporated atleast 3 poetry craft choices. We then made a collage for both topics to support our poems.

		<h3>Child Labor Poem:</h3>
		<p>When I was just a little boy
		I’ve worked at the N.Y. Button Works.
		Working in the harshest conditions
		Covered in dirt as black as coal.

		When I was just a little boy
		Instead of being a normal child who’d play outside
		My mother forced me into this factory 
		Like a moth to the flame that I am.

		When I was just a little boy
		Working on the 1st floor,
		Twining and twining
		Getting my little fingers caught in the machines
		That often ran so quickly,
		Quicker than the speed of light.

		When I was just a little boy
		I dreaded going to work
		The factory was a prison.

		As a little boy
		I just wanted to go to school
		Have the time of my life
		But I couldn’t.</p>

		<h3>Social Media + Relationships Poem:</h3>
		<p>There are too many things,
		Too many things I want to do with you.

		Baseball games
		In the blistering heat
		So I can Instagram our love.

		Trips to the city 
		Tweeting,
		Vaguely enough to make people wonder,
		How much fun we had that night.

		I tried my best
		My very best to impress,
		Impress you and only you on instagram
		I even went ham.

		As I liked your photos
		To get your attention
		It felt like a hike.

		I was hoping you’d comment on my photos
		But I bet you’d rather vomit that night.

		Even though I haven’t been serious in the past
		I wanted to make sure we’d last.

		I’m searching and searching
		For info about you
		And what I should do
		Since I’m interested in you.

		Even though I’m as nervous as a long tailed cat 
		In a room full of rocking chairs,
		I still tried to flirt and talk to you in person
		But it just seems to stench of failure.

		Even though I haven’t been serious in the past
		I’m going to make sure we’d last.</p>
